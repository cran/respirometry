Description: Provides tools to enable the researcher to more precisely conduct
    respirometry experiments. Strong emphasis is on aquatic respirometry. Tools
    focus on helping the researcher setup and conduct experiments. Functions for
    analysis of resulting respirometry data are also provided. This package
    provides tools for intermittent, flow-through, and closed respirometry
    techniques.
